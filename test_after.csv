清末，法国使臣罗杰斯对中国皇帝说：“你们的太监制度将健康人变成残疾，很不人道。”还没等皇帝回话，贴身太监姚勋抢嘴道——“这是陛下的恩赐，奴才们心甘情愿。怎可诋毁我大清国律，干涉我大清内政！？”",

"As long as cost reigns supreme in supply chain decisions, China is likely to dominate rare earth w little accountability for mining methods, analysts said. Villagers in places like Yulin and Zhongshan, Guangxi province, will pay the price.",
"“Some companies are.. not comfortable w ppl dumping acid in the middle of a forest in southern China,” said Eugene Gholz. ""But not interested enough to spend the $ to drive up the price of heavy rare earth to the pt where they’re profitably produced from the Australian mine.”",
"In 2010, worried about rare earth, Congress asked GAO to evaluate US defense supply chain vulnerability. The GAO found it could take 15 yrs for the US to catch up w China. Since then, little has changed, in part bc few places can compete w China’s low cost, high pollution model.",
"How did the supply chain become so warped? 1) China invested more in rare earth than anyone else 2) Companies and consumers prioritized low costs above supply security or environmental concerns. “The market has done this to itself,” said Gareth Hatch.",
"We use rare earth in cell phones, laptops, wind turbines, electric cars - demand will only increase as more countries transition to green energy, &amp; the dominant producer is China. The US has only 1 rare earth mine, and it relies on China to process what it mines.",
"Some environmentalists say rare earth should be treated as a conflict mineral, like blood diamonds. “If you’re a shareholder of Apple or whatever company might use rare earth...they need to look into the risks. It’s not just about supply disruption, it’s also about reputation”",
"When we tried to meet protesters in one of these villages, police threatened them &amp; blocked the village entrance so no one could go in or out. “Rare earth is a special-privilege resource,” Qin said.",
"Qin Yongpei, a Nanning-based lawyer who had his license revoked in crackdown on human rights lawyers, told us about 2 cases where villagers were arrested for protesting rare earth mining. “Mountains of gold &amp; silver are not as good as mountains of blue &amp; green,” they’d protested",
"Beijing blames illegal mining for the pollution and wants to clean up rare earth, in part by consolidating mining under state-owned enterprises. But Guangxi locals said SOEs used the same methods and operated w even more impunity, bc they have authorities’ support.",
"Rare earth mining methods in southern China are “savage,” Greenpeace Beijing said. “They’re pouring chemical acids directly into the earth.” Villagers who can’t afford to move away from heavily mined areas end up in “cancer villages.” When they protest, they are arrested.",
"Why focus on environment? Bc rare earth is what environmentalist Ma Jun calls a “classic case” of China getting industrial advantage by having its people, earth and water bear the costs of sickness and pollution so that no one can compete w China’s low costs",

@aliceysu @scoopercooper @latimes I hope that the current smuggling of Opium/fentanyl into the West is not considered payback for the past. That would be sad.,
@aliceysu @orvilleschell Despite @orvilleschell’s predictions,
"Qing China’s problems were weak governance and poverty, said a retired coal mine engineer from Shandong. “Now it’s not possible to have unequal treaties, because now China is wealthy and strong.”",
"That doesn’t matter to many Chinese who care more about being rich, strong, and able to fend off foreign influence. “America is strong, but it can’t do whatever it wants anymore,” said a tourist on a trip w her parents from Yunnan.",
"China hasn’t moved towards congruence with the open markets and open politics of a US-led global system, said @orvilleschell, despite decades of what Americans view as compromise and lenient engagement",
"@aliceysu @Bkerrychina Oh, a good combo for sure. As they say: https://t.co/6Bn8ZAiPQj",
"“America feels like it’s been giving too much and never been getting what it really wanted.” US supported WTO access and opened markets to China, but China hasn’t democratized or liberalized in the way the US expected.",
"The perception gap between US and China is one of entitlement on both sides, said @Bkerrychina. “China feels like it morally deserves this moment of renaissance after its terrible modern history, and doesn’t feel like the West has the right to stop it”",
"As China raised retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion of US goods, two medical students from Shandong said they felt confident China could negotiate on equal ground. “China isn’t scared of anything anymore. Whatever happens with the trade war, I don’t think we’ll lose,” one said.",
"One grandfather walked his grandson out of these ruins. “See what the foreigners did to us? The country needs to be strong, or else you get bullied,” he said. https://t.co/VAgsjTkN9W",
"In 1860, British and French forces ravaged this Qing dynasty palace in a war fought over a trade deficit and access to China’s markets https://t.co/TkK24bJNcv",

"After a trip full of heavy history &amp; strident propaganda, I loved meeting a 躺平 millennial who shrugged it all off and said his model for life is this quote from Keanu Reeves. Young ppl aren’t so different worldwide, he said. There’s just too much baggage from older generations. https://t.co/zQPFBK1oUt",
"We also did go to some red sites. Dazhai, the model people’s commune where a museum makes no mention of famine but teaches visitors that faith in the Party works miracles. Shanghai, where Xintiandi nightlife surrounds the Party’s founding site. https://t.co/FtXyfT7ASQ",
"Second to that was Leiyang, home to villages full of dying workers. They are migrant workers who dug the foundations for Shenzhen’s high-rises, now sick w incurable silicosis. “大家都说现在的社会那么好。日子越来越好过,” the wife of one dying man told me. “谁不想活下去？” https://t.co/biUosdbgkR",
"The place that struck me most was Jiabiangou, a re-education through labor camp in the desert of Gansu, where 2,000+ purged “rightists” starved to death. Survivors who tried to commemorate the site have been harassed by police. We found human bones still lying in the sand. https://t.co/SGhffxEjYS",
Every stop was plastered w slogans that draw on the Party’s past. 自力更生 奋发图强。不忘初心 牢记使命。扫黑除恶 刮骨疗毒。永远跟着党走。落后就会挨打。Some ppl shout &amp; sing these slogans. Some hear them &amp; their eyes glaze over in boredom. Some think of the past and are afraid. https://t.co/axVz56JAGl,
"Along the way, we met people whose lives have risen and fallen with different Party eras. Sent-down youth who now speak with pride of their suffering. Imams under newly tightened surveillance. Children writing love letters to the Party, and millennials who just want to lie down. https://t.co/oMqHW30Tbr",

Many thanks to @TheWCS @CBCGDF_China for their help w this story. You can read it @latimes: https://t.co/qsvpH9RBO4,
@aliceysu @DSORennie Almost as many loopholes as the ban on travel from China...,
"The question now is whether Beijing will choose to protect the interests of that multibillion $ industry or the lives of those it has harmed - dozens of endangered animal species and now billions of humans affected by COVID-19, including tens of thousands who have died.",
"China's wildlife problem is not primarily about culture - the majority of Chinese people DON'T eat wildlife! It is a problem of money and power and a $73 billion industry that employs 14 million ppl, and that the govt has been pushing as a good business for poverty alleviation",
"That company was later implicated in a criminal case of wildlife trafficking involving more than 50,000 smuggled pangolins. (Pangolins are like sandshrews, see picture! And they are facing extinction.) Also they are a suspected intermediate host of the new coronavirus. https://t.co/7d0tfLWAq6",
"The current wildlife ban punishes consumers for eating wildlife, but does not tackle corporate interests or official corruption. Last year, we reported on provincial authorities who gave pangolin breeding permits to a STEEL COMPANY: https://t.co/tyDah2seke",
"They are: Liu Jianshun, president of 漳州片仔癀, a medicine made w deer musk, cow gallstone &amp; snake bile; Gao Zhenkun, managing director of 北京同仁堂, famous for tiger bone wine; and Guo Jiaxue, head of 广誉远, whose trademark product traditionally includes pangolin scales.",
"But TCM companies already hold significant sway over wildlife ""protection"" - which usually means farming - in China. Three out of 14 vice-chairs of the China Wildlife Conservation Association's board, for example, are TCM company executives.",
@aliceysu While China maintains practices like these the US should end imports from CN.,
"A study from German &amp; Chinese researchers on bat species used for TCM, five of which are hosts of coronaviruses, three of which can be found in Hubei: https://t.co/mrh79vwUVb",
"Example: BATS. The horseshoe bat, suspected host of SARS-CoV-2 (the new coronavirus), can be found in Hubei. It's one of several bat species used commercially in China for TCM. Ppl harvest the bat's feces to make 夜明砂, ""night brightness sand,"" a remedy for eye problems",
"Those treatments include 痰热清, a bear-bile based remedy recommended in the latest ed. of China's national guidelines for COVID-19 care. China is promoting wildlife-based medicine for a disease that scientists agree came from wildlife, while also banning wildlife trade..!",
"China has now banned wildlife consumption &amp; trade again. But the ban has major loopholes: it only covers land animals. It doesn't cover use of wildlife for medicine - including TCM remedies that China is pushing as treatment for COVID-19, despite no clinical proof that they work",
"Why does the wildlife trade matter? Bc close interaction w wild animals, esp multiple species raised and sold in cramped spaces, raises the risk of zoonotic disease transmission - illnesses that jump from animals to humans, like SARS, Ebola, HIV/AIDS, avian flu, and #COVID19.",
"How did this happen? Under China's Wildlife Protection Law, 54 types of wild animals, civets included, can be legally farmed &amp; sold for consumption, as long as they have govt permits. The idea is that farming animals for sale will leave those in the wild untouched &amp; ""protected""",
"Jiangxi report on govt help for civet breeders: “The cold winter wind was screaming, but Zhang Zhilin, a poor farmer in Wanan county had a ‘warm sun’ in his heart. The 33 civet cats he bred would come out for sale next year, bringing in $7,000 of income."" https://t.co/3xbansLhna",
"In 2003, Chinese authorities banned wildlife consumption. Tens of thousands of civets, suspected intermediate carrier of SARS virus, were killed. But 3 months later, the ban was lifted. By 2019, govt subsidies were helping thousands of farmers pivot into civet breeding (!)",

@aliceysu This was such a good story.,

@aliceysu @klustout Is the Western media being paid by the Chinese government? It would explain why they decided to collectively piss away every iota of their credibility in the last four years and make their opinions meaningless to a vast majority of their one-time viewership.,
"But NGOs also worry about physical protection, esp as they move from fact-checking to exposing Chinese influence networks. Pro-Beijing gangs have attacked student protesters in Taiwan in the past and in HK in recent months. ""It's not safe for us to do this,"" one researcher said.",
"Keeping speech free and the Internet open is aligned w Taiwan's core values, @audreyt said. “Our kind of defining identity is to be not what the PRC is.. Freedom of speech, assembly and press are not something instrumental that you can kind of trade away.""",
"Instead, Taiwan is bolstering civil society - a decision that provides a case study for other democracies worried about fake news and keeping freedom of speech at the same time, and facing potential foreign influence in upcoming elections (who could that be? haha..)",
"Taiwan doesn't want to use govt power to crack down on fake news, in contrast to nearby Vietnam and Singapore. Haunted by its authoritarian past, TW has struggled to pass an anti-infiltration bill that critics say brings back ""White Terror"" under nearly 4 decades of martial law.",
"But Chinese disinfo is getting smarter, often working directly with Taiwanese ""online marketing"" agencies or individuals co-opted through the CCP's United Front tactics (coercion, bribery) to spread China's message within private social circles, in a seemingly Taiwanese voice.",
"Taiwanese civil society, including orgs like @taiwantfc, CoFacts &amp; DoubleThink Labs, are battling fake posts that often start in China, go to Chinese-owned or funded content farms based in SE Asia or Taiwan, get shared on FB, then move into private chats on LINE.",
@aliceysu Salad is the dish of the devil,
"The ""news pages"" and accounts sharing these posts often follow a pattern Russian disinformation used on the US: building readership through harmless content, then turning political at the right time - like in the lead-up to elections in Taiwan right now.",

@aliceysu The UN was never about the people so I'm more surprised when some people of conscience within its confines still manage to achieve something good.,
@aliceysu The CCP will just play the fool like always.,
"Meanwhile the victims of atrocities suffer. More than 200 Uyghur, Tibetan, HKer and other groups have spoken against the trip. ""We should be telling her where our families are held, not the Chinese govt,"" says @RayhanAsat. The UN loses not only credibility but also victims' trust",
"That kind of discretion can backfire. A would-be investigation turns into a ""learning opportunity"". Instead of collecting important evidence on virus origins or re-education camps, the UN becomes part of China's story about public health and counter-terrorism success",
"If the human rights office disclosed the terms of their trip, govts could help pressure China to uphold them. But they are treating the trip like a bilateral matter between China and the UN, just as the WHO treated its trips investigating covid origins in 2020 and 2021",
"But China has made clear that it will be a ""friendly visit"" under covid restrictions, not a fact-finding mission. Diplomats in Beijing expect ""Olympic bubble"" treatment for Bachelet w no free movement, let alone access to prisons, govt documents, or unsupervised interviews",
In Dec the UN human rights office said the report was ready. Then it was pushed back until after the Olympics. Now they say it will come after this trip + sharing with Chinese authorities to get their views. If the trip was an unfettered investigation that could make sense,
UN researchers have been working on a report about Xinjiang for more than 3 years. Scholars who helped them interview camp victims across countries say they've compiled damning evidence of mass atrocities. But when and how that evidence is released is not up to them.,

@aliceysu 关于个人权利方面，维持稳定的确需要让渡个人权利，主要包括公开发表或出版政治见解的门槛很高。但是这其实可以忍受，也不是中国人普遍关注的领域。有效的治理应当是为国民的生存提供保障，允许国民追求财富、健康积极的享乐，或各种领域的创造与贡献。在这些方面中国人享有充分的自由、保护、和支持。,
@aliceysu 首先从意识形态上，「共产主义中国」和「共产党治理下的中国」是不同的两个概念，这是现在西方舆论仍然混淆且不愿厘清的。比起理论基础，现在中国的体制非常灵活且务实，并且保障了政治经济政策的一贯性。稳定与团结是经济发展的前提，相反不稳定和分裂会加剧衰退，这是眼下全世界都在学习的功课。,
@aliceysu 国家主权和个人权利本身就是两个话题。国家主权和既成执政者/党的合法性是应当尽可能被尊重的，这应该是各国能够达成共识的。而个人权利的边界是可以开放探讨的，但作为国家内部事务也应当被尽可能尊重。现在西方舆论在以个人权利为由头去挑战国家主权和合法性，这破坏了展开讨论的基本假设。,

"@strategyrick @aliceysu @hkdemonow We saw what a humanity crisis it was in CQ and surrounding area last yr. Ppl died in the thousands and unlike those who died elsewhere, their deaths are forever written off in history by CCP. Not all ppl are stupid &amp; a tool like u.",
@aliceysu Your data suggests what we already know: thousands of years under the thumb of emperors then the CCP has developed a deep sense of caution among the people in uttering ugly truths about power.,
"@shiqiaoma @aliceysu @hkdemonow I say people in China are happy with the way China has managed the pandemic, and you respond with birthrates, ignoring that housing costs and birthrates are negatively correlated? Got any other gems for us today?🤣",
"@strategyrick @aliceysu @hkdemonow Yes, just look at your natl birth rate and see how much a success CCP has been in practicing animal husbandry on its ppl. Chinese ppl know better, they are not just voting with their feet, they're voting with their uterus.",
"@shiqiaoma @aliceysu @hkdemonow 20 years of economic growth has earned the CCP a lot of support. Ppl I know in China are astonished at the failure of gov'ts in most of the world to respond to the pandemic, and happy with China's effectiveness. They see our leaders as bumbling idiots, and they're right.",
"@aliceysu Whoever wrote this piece doesn’t understand that in China there are comments made for public appearance and comments made for one’s closest friends &amp; family members. The latter of these are usually incredibly critical of the government, but are never shared publicly out of fear",
@PaulNewland15 Humanity is 500k covid deaths 🙄,
@aliceysu @hkdemonow Those ppl in Jonestown really trusted Jim Jones all the way to that Kool Aid party.,
@aliceysu It might just be that the Cultural Revolution throws a long cultural shadow...,
"@BeijingPalmer @aliceysu The data may be dubious, but the basic point is true. Approval for the chinese government is high within the country, excepting certain ethnic minorities.",
"@BeijingPalmer @aliceysu Don’t worry, that 1% will be dealt with...",
@aliceysu a harmonious ant-like society blindly following ideological pheromones 🤔,
@aliceysu Expressing cynicism about the government is an independent circle from the Chinese citizenship circle on the Venn diagram.,
"@BeijingPalmer @aliceysu His analysis is more sophisticated than that - shows much more trust in central level government relative to baseline than at local government.  Though certainly not definitive, my reporting experience over last 16 months accords with this spread.",
@BeijingPalmer @aliceysu It's intellectually easy to criticize Chinese gov repeatedly everyday despite zero new information or knowledge to learn or pass to others. What might be new to you and your readers is what they did right and why some people do like them.,
@BeijingPalmer @aliceysu Soviets also never had that good internal propaganda and such tight control over media. I think people very often omit this point. Comparing 1980 to 2020 is always going to be a bit leaky.,
@BeijingPalmer @aliceysu We have been forced to give up our freedom to exchange safety and the gov does give us safety which is trusted by the people. Is that hard to understand?,
@BeijingPalmer @aliceysu copium,
"@BeijingPalmer @aliceysu Yep. I trust this data about as much as I trust poll data asking “do you have a firearm in the house”, for very similar reasons.",
@aliceysu 好歹他们还在讲啊。,
@BeijingPalmer @aliceysu Exactly. CCP kept saying there were almost no cases of covid in China. But everyone wears masks in the videos I see.,
"@aliceysu Stockholm Syndrome, anyone?",
"@aliceysu every time I see pieces like this I think of the people who believed that Soviet officials really *did* get 100% of the vote.

they're very slightly useful in showing deviance from a baseline of previous results, that's about it.",

"@bradsharkip @aliceysu @dtiffroberts If they are part time, they could probably be terminated at will. And there is the question whether public and private schools have allowed their teachers to take outside part time teaching positions",
"@china_laborlaw @aliceysu @dtiffroberts I think the teachers are part-time. Recently, the government closed a lot of family tutor companies to ensure the students could have spare time to play and enjoy justice education.",
@china_laborlaw @aliceysu @dtiffroberts For certain people perhaps. Not for everyone.,
"@Liddokun @aliceysu @dtiffroberts No, you file a claim in labor arbitration. It’s pretty simple",
@china_laborlaw @aliceysu @dtiffroberts How to petition the CCP government like a good commie peon. Kneel and beg. https://t.co/J9sZNrN4bm,
@Liddokun @aliceysu @dtiffroberts Not what I see every day. What’s your experience in China?,
"@china_laborlaw @aliceysu @dtiffroberts China has a lot of “labor laws” on the books, except the reality is nobody follows or enforces them. It’s useless to have laws if it is arbitrarily applied (or not). And there are few venues for labor dispute arbitration in China. This has always been the problem in China.",
@china_laborlaw @aliceysu @dtiffroberts No one in China EVER obeys labor laws.,
"@aliceysu @dtiffroberts The story also doesn’t clarify whether the teachers are full time, and thus protected by most of the laws, or only part time, and thus probably could be terminated at will.",
"@aliceysu @dtiffroberts This story seems to confuse the issues of unfair termination, claims for unpaid wages, and payment of legally required severance. If the new regulations on tutoring required suspension of the business, then there might be grounds for termination.",

"@stanfordchiou @stiles @aliceysu @ronlin Green propaganda likes to say how much ""Tawianese"" KMT killed, but if you do the math, you'll find that half of the killed were ""people from other provinces"", who only took 20% of the whole population. The truth is that KMT was targeting CPC, not Taiwanese.",
"@stanfordchiou @stiles @aliceysu @ronlin KMT vs Japan theory is a BS made by colse-to-present DPP narrative. It used information assymetry. People had more direct memory with KMT than Jap, so they just mention KMT's bad and hide Jap's crime.",

@aliceysu @mike_mazza @latimes Thank you. I found this so enlightening. Would love to read further articles delving deeper / interviewing more families!,
@aliceysu @SBengali @latimes A must read article for sociologists,
"@aliceysu @latimes Deeply touched by the story. I'm just like Shayne Mei, a grandson of an old ROC veteran. It feels like you are writing my story as well, though both of my grandparents came from China. It's the best story I've read about Taiwanese identity.",
"@vialosangeles1 @stanfordchiou @stiles @aliceysu @ronlin Yeah, I am a troll. Really funny when you have no effective arguments rather than calling others troll. You only allow one voice. Other voices are wrong because they are from haters, misogynists, trolls, etc. What a democracy.",
@stanfordchiou @lmk_ir @stiles @aliceysu Agreed 100%,
"@stanfordchiou @stiles @aliceysu @ronlin The point of these changes is to infuse Taiwan's independent status at children's young age. Every expression started with ""Taiwan's perspective"" in the name of objectivity and points to the conclusion of TW independence. Those are circular reasoning.",
"@stanfordchiou @stiles @aliceysu @ronlin Then Chen Shui-bian made big modification to history textbooks, including calling 1895 to1945 the time under Japan's management (日治时代) rather than the time Taiwan was occupied by Japan (日据时代). Now Taiwan is the only place which miss the time when they were colonized.",
"@stanfordchiou @stiles @aliceysu @ronlin If you do a cross-check, this generation matches the reform of education starting form Lee Teng-hui. He started with a textbook called 认识台湾(get to know TW), whose seperation intention was not salient. The book was the start of putting the name of Taiwan in highest priority.",
@stanfordchiou @stiles @aliceysu @ronlin It is also absurd to think KMT is Taiwan's only connection to China. KMT got into Taiwan because Taiwan is China's territory and people in Taiwan are Chinese. Taiwan's young generation doesn't think so because of the absence of education.,
"@stanfordchiou @stiles @aliceysu @ronlin However, no country is a country just by thinking. Many people in Taiwan can list the points which they think can justify their difference to ""China"", but they are actually not differences between two countries. You can find most of them exists between Beijing and Shanghai.",
"@aliceysu @LATimesGraphics The 90s shift occurred because people finally felt comfortable about expressing a Taiwanese identity. Nobody so rapidly gives up a real social identity 

Important shift is the old Taiwanese generation to the current post-independence generation.",
"@aliceysu @latimes This is so interesting, thank you!",
"@lmk_ir @stiles @stanfordchiou @aliceysu Far, far, more than 10% of Taiwanese-Americans are descended from KMT families though. I think that accounts for a lot of the distorted coverage, although it certainly doesn’t excuse it.",
"@aliceysu Thanks for writing this story! Though both sides of my family are bengshenren, they experienced very different treatment by the KMT, and to this day, have very different politics. I had a glimpse growing up in the US but learned more while living in Taiwan for 2.5 years &lt;3",
"@aliceysu @terencelau WAIT update, my dad said, ""It's not a super positive term, don't say it!""",
"@aliceysu My dad just taught me a term for KMT soldier + Taiwanese woman marriages: o-ah-han-ji. O-ah is Taiwanese for taro, describing the KMT soldier. Han-ji is yam, for the Taiwanese woman (Taiwan in general = yam). @terencelau",
@aliceysu And then there are many mixed-ethnic families of benshen + waishen... also fascinating when KMT Taiwanese migrate out of Taiwan. Too many sides to the political drama. Curious why no mom wanted to go on record.,
"@Chenyi_Takeyama @aliceysu @latimes You’re implying all benshenren, still in Taiwan, relates more to Japan than China? That’s an outright lie.",
"@cindweeb Hello! I did interview the girlfriend, she is in the piece. The grandmother’s memory wasn’t clear enough and the mother didn’t want to be interviewed. I did also feel that we didn’t have enough women’s voices, but these are the people who were willing to open up on the record",
"@aliceysu @latimes Love this piece. Hits close to home and would read so, so many more pieces on this subject if you write them(!)",
@aliceysu Also this is a question that’s already been answered multiple times all over the internet. I’d suggest checking out some of the Asian American/Taiwan subreddits.,
"@aliceysu But since a lot of my childhood was spent in Taiwan, I feel rooted in its culture, language, and traditions. I am American and I am Taiwanese.",
"@aliceysu I was born and raised in both Taiwan and US, but my father always told me to insist that I am American (not Taiwanese American) when people asked. He said it’s bc not everyone has to identify their ancestry when asked (1st gen European Americans) - why should I?",
"@aliceysu Yo, from a benshenren family here, so obviously always said “Taiwanese” for generations. I’m curious why you didn’t question any of the women (the grandmother in the story, the grandson’s girlfriend), as they must have interesting takes as well.",
@Chenyi_Takeyama @aliceysu @latimes Yes! I came here to say the same thing.,
"@aliceysu @latimes I know it because I came from that background, from my dad's side.",
"@aliceysu @latimes Also,these families who don't consider themselves as Chinese, relate more to Japanese.",
"@aliceysu @latimes The type of the family in your interview that immigrated from China just after WW II, only occupied 12% of the total population of Taiwan in 1947. So people shouldn't be surprised why many Taiwanese don't even consider themselves Chinese.",
"@aliceysu @latimes Many cases,including 2 friends of mine, one went to a major medical research center that collects Taiwanese DNA to test her own, one asked https://t.co/JvFfbPeeFQ to verify his DNA, both got the result of 90% Polynesian 10% Filipino",
"@aliceysu @latimes This interview only represents the families that moved to Taiwan after WW II.There are also families that have been living in Taiwan for many hundreds years,a medical research has supported them as “non-Chinese” but purely Taiwanese.They are not considered as aboriginal people.",
"@aliceysu In a 本省人 family like mine, I was always taught by my parents, 阿媽 and 阿公 that we were 台灣人, not 中國人, and therefore never had an identity gap, but this constant firm belief. My grandparents would likely relate more to Japan than China.",
"@aliceysu but at the same time, ""Malaysian-Chinese-Australian"" is too much of a mouthful and I don't have the time/patience to explain diaspora to most people",
"@aliceysu My parents are Malaysian-Chinese, raised in Malaysia, my grandparents were originally from China (but I never got to meet them). My sister and I were born and raised in Australia. I feel super uncomfortable with the label ""Chinese"" bc I'm not ""from China""",
"@aliceysu My mother, born and raised in Taiwan, is a staunch Taiwan-not-China person. She told me this ever since I was little, and we both followed the Sunflower Movement closely, though we mostly love in America, where I was born and grew up.",
@aliceysu @latimes Thank you for this piece. It's about time someone cleared up the opinions between the age groups in this country.,
"@aliceysu I know the generation that grew up under Japanese rule are dying out, but I wonder how that affects Taiwanese self-identity--esp as, as others have noted, I would imagine that this would be a significant factor in the different ways pre- vs post-'49 Han diasporas relate to it",
"@aliceysu but it's also that gap re: self-identity that you note. My mother would never say she was a 大陸人, but I'm much more firmly Taiwan-not-China than her. (We've had to stop talking non-US politics.) My grandma would probs have identified more closely w/ Japan, tho",
"@stiles @stanfordchiou @aliceysu In fact, only about 10% of Taiwanese are descended from KMT families. Imagine if the media covered South African society and only depicted white families, as if the entire population was white.",
"@aliceysu I'm in the EU so I can't seem to read the full article, but thanks for your twitter summary! My mother's Taiwanese-born and bred; I was born and grew up in the US. There's definitely a political gap between us already--she chalks it up in large part to Western culture/morals",
"@aliceysu @latimes Beautifully written piece that clearly “explained” some of the most subtle yet complicated issue in Taiwan’s society. This is a reflection of many Taiwanese families, including my own.",
@aliceysu @latimes This is so good! I grew up thinking I was Chinese-American. My experience of working in mainland China as an adult and meeting  actual Chinese people made me realize my identity was more reflective of the Taiwanese-American diaspora than of being Chinese.,
@katherine_lee1 @aliceysu @latimes Very good piece .,
"@aliceysu @latimes This was just fascinating. I came to the US from Taiwan when I was 3 years old and while I am a US citizen, I think of myself as culturally 'from Taiwan' even tho my mother's fam fled China in 1949. Thanks for the story. I'm passing it on to my parents to read.",
"@stanfordchiou @aliceysu That, and the sample size of people I encountered in trips there has been small. Fortunately I have @ronlin in the office to set me straight.",

"This was just one family out of many, but they reflect a broader trend, according to polls since 1992, in Taiwanese identity shifting toward Taiwanese only or Taiwanese + Chinese, and away from just being Chinese. (Thanks to @LATimesGraphics for this chart!) https://t.co/s2eb6qICoh",
"For many Taiwanese, being Chinese doesn't mean belonging to China. That's a shocking concept for many mainland Chinese, but not abroad. In families like this, it only takes 1-2 generations for a sense of belonging to disappear, even while family ties remain.",
"There's a distinction between 華人, ethnic Chinese, and 中國人，China-person, that gets lost in English. It's important to Chinese diaspora in Taiwan but also in Malaysia, Singapore, the US, and more, bc it distinguishes between ethnicity and citizenship, heritage and belonging.",
"The son, age 23, is a millennial graduate of National Taiwan University who speaks perfect English and supports same-sex marriage. He's what people here call a generation of 天然獨, ""born independent."" His dream is to move to Seattle and work for Amazon.",
"The father, age 55, is a Kaohsiung businessman who studied abroad in the U.S. He grew up calling himself Chinese, but now resents Chinese bullying towards Taiwan. ""It comes down to power,"" he said re: China-Taiwan relations.",
"The grandfather, age 87, was a KMT soldier who fled his Anhui village at age 17 to join the army and ended up in Taiwan. 42 years passed before he returned to his village, only to find that his parents and siblings had starved to death in the 1960s famine.",
